							<h3><font size="5">Visit wastewater treatment plant</font></h3>
							<p>In chengdu, we found that the fourth and eighth water treatment plants are more suitable for field investigation. In the part of human practice, we will first get in touch with the water treatment plant, and then organize students to visit the water treatment plant, at the same time, we will ask the staff of the water treatment plant about the working process and principle of the water treatment plant, so that our device can be added in the part of the working process of the water treatment plant.The work of water treatment plants can allow us to do better research on how to put the results into actual water purification process.</p>
							<h3><font size="5">Consult the expert</font></h3>
							<p>After visiting the water treatment plant, we will also contact famous domestic sewage treatment experts to ask about the types of antibiotics in existing microbial sewage treatment and the efficiency of treatment of wastewater.</p>
							<h3><font size="5">Hold a seminar</font></h3>
							<p>After understanding the basic operation of the sewage treatment plant and the relevant situation, which is shared by experts on the existing microbial treatment of sewage, we will have a discussion, and invite teachers and students who are interested or have learned it before to participate in it. In the seminar, we will open our imagination to imagine the role that  engineering e. coli may play in sewage treatment.</p>
							<h3><font size="5">Create a funny game</font></h3>
							<p>To make our project truly public, we decided to create a game based on our project. The name of the game is “I love eating fish”. First of all, we will make the game into a card type, which can control the cost and is convenient to operate. In the promotion, we will also collect feedback from players. When the game becomes more interesting, we will transfer the card into a sand table with toys to enrich the game. And because the rules of the game are based on our project, our project will be better known with the popular of game, and the purpose of social practice will be eventually achieved.</p>
